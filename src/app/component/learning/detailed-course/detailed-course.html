                Knowledge can be defined as awareness of facts or as practical
                skills, and may also refer to familiarity with objects or
                situations. Knowledge of facts, also called propositional
                knowledge, is often defined as true belief that is distinct from
                opinion or guesswork by virtue of justification. While there is
                wide agreement among philosophers that it is a form of true
                belief, many controversies in philosophy focus on justification:
                whether it is needed at all, how to understand it, and whether
                something else besides it is needed.

                Knowledge can be produced in many different ways. The most
                important source is perception, which refers to the usage of the
                five senses. Many theorists also include introspection as a
                source of knowledge, not of external physical objects, but of
                one's own mental states. Other sources often discussed include
                memory, rational intuition, inference, and testimony. According
                to foundationalism, some of these sources are basic in the sense
                that they can justify beliefs without depending on other mental
                states. This claim is rejected by coherentists.
